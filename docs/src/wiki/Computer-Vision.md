# What is it?

Computer Vision is used throughout OpenPnP to detect exactly where things are in relation to the cameras, sometimes to just determine _if_ they are there, and sometimes to read text (OCR) or codes (QR-Codes). Computer vision mostly uses a facility called Pipeline to perform the detection. The Pipeline is structured in so-called Stages that the user can configure in a special Pipeline Editor. 

This page links to detailed instructions for some tasks around Computer Vision. 


# Stages

* [[DetectCircularSymmetry]] searches the image for Circular Symmetry. It can be used to detect round things, regardless of their color, brightness, contrast, even if sharp edges are absent. The stage is very robust and self-tuning. 

* [[DetectRectlinearSymmetry]] searches the image for Rec-linear Symmetry. It can be used to detect left-right and/or upper/lower symmetric things, obviously electronic parts. The stage is very robust and self-tuning. 

* [[MaskHsv]] suppresses certain ranges of colors in the image. It is typically used for "green-screening" in bottom vision or for the [[BlindsFeeder]].

* [[MinAreaRect]] finds the smallest area rotated rectangle around a subject.

* [[ImageRead]] reads an image into the pipeline. It can be used as a template, or to simulate a captured image for testing.

## Using New Stock Pipelines

OpenPnP ships with stock pipelines that you can use or adapt to your liking. When you update OpenPnP the newest stock pipeline is made available, but it is not automatically replacing your pipelines, as this would likely break your adaptations, of course. Therefore, if you want to upgrade to the newest stock pipeline, and replace yours, it takes a few steps. This is explained for the Bottom Vision pipeline here, but it is similar with other vision settings. 

1. Go to the Stock vision setting.
1. Press the **Copy** button on the pipeline panel:

   ![Stock pipeline copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/155850071-018b769e-8f22-481b-8288-a6f0f50d51a0.png)

1. Go to the vision settings, where you want to try the new pipeline.
1. Press the **Paste** button on the pipeline panel.

1. Then test the new settings by using **Test Align** etc.

If you want to use the Stock pipeline as your new default:

1. You can also _directly_ set the new Stock pipeline on the "Default Machine Bottom Vision" settings by pressing the **Reset** button:

# Tweaking Pipeline Parameters

Some essential tweaking parameters can be exposed from a pipeline. See the [[Exposed Pipeline Parameters]] page for how to use this, or for how to create your own parameters. 

# Editing Pipelines

The usage of the Pipeline Editor UI in general is explained on the [[CvPipeline]] page.

# Overriding Controlled Stage Properties

Some pipeline stage properties are controlled by vision operations in OpenPnP. There are usually very good reasons for the way these are controlled, so you should normally leave this control in place. However, in exotic circumstances it might become necessary to override the control.

The following animation shows, how the stage control can be enabled/disabled by changing the `propertyName` property. A minus sign is added to the well-know property name (any other name change would work too), which means that the _control connection_ is lost, and user edits are made possible again. If you are just trying this out, please do not forget to revert the change, to restore the _control connection_:

![disabling-control](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/157468527-91be5498-9e59-4d35-ac6b-62899b337904.gif)

This does only work with built-in control. In case of [Exposed Pipeline Parameters](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Exposed-Pipeline-Parameters) just disable the parameter stage instead.

# Bottom Vision Background Removal

OpenPnP can automatically calibrate the background (with empty nozzle tip) for bottom vision background removal. See the [[Nozzle Tip Background Calibration]] page.
