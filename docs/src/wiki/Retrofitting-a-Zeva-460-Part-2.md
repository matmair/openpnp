First version of machine has been working for a while (short) and I have decided to add rotation of component. (Initial machine had mechanical centering and only 90 degree rotation).

I have 3D PRinted some gears and I have made a support for a stepper motor. Unfortunately disaster was near.

Without air pressure applied, Z head was lowered and I have commanded a movement on Y.  This was fatal for placing head, where bent telescopic shafts from head and I have not been able to straighten them back as initial.

I have made another mounting head inspired by various information on group using CP40 nozzle.

PRoject it's available here :+1: http://a360.co/2jmV71v 
 
Since my initial version of retrofit, now OpenPnP has support for Uplooking Camera and this improves a lot placement precision.

I have changed as well the motion controller. 
I have switched from TinyG to Smoothie.  There are a lot of references for Smoothie configuration and this makes everything more easy. One single comment I have here, it looks that S ramp acceleration profile it makes machine to move nicer/softer.

I have made my own version of board started at that time from a design found on Hackaday.io , design started initially by Cristian LErche. PRoject it's available here (to add).


Will follow :+1: - nozzle changer 
- drag pin feeder with pneumatic
