## ImageRead Stage

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/156917949-f338f79a-fbb9-4f62-bef8-828a4702abdd.png)

Reads an image from a file, as given in the **file** property.

The **colorSpace** indicates how the color information should be handled in the pipeline.

To facilitate testing with pre-captured images, which may come from other users/machines/cameras, the ImageRead stage can try to emulate a camera-captured image. 

**handleAsCaptured**, if enabled, handles the loaded image as if captured by our own camera. The image resolution and aspect ratio is adapted, and if information is present, the image is also scaled to our own camera Units per Pixel. Any pixel coordinates obtained from the image are therefore correctly interpreted, as they would from our own camera captured images. The converted image is also registered as the pipeline captured image.

Images are scaled, cropped and/or extended with black borders, as needed. 

The Units per Pixel information is given in a `upp.txt` file which must reside side-by-side with the image file. The `upp.txt` simply contains the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) UPP millimeter values, separated by a space. This is the convention, as adopted in the [openpnp-test-images](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-test-images) repository for user test images.
