## What is it?

The **Holistic Machine Calibration** aims to integrate the calibration of many machine elements (axes, cameras, nozzles etc.) into relatively few calibration procedures. Instead of treating each machine element separately (and mostly manually), the elements are brought into functional interplay and calibrations are derived from there. The functional interplay is reminiscent of what the Pick & Place machine actually does when operating, therefore calibrations are quite purpose oriented. Instead of using outside references such as millimeter paper etc. it uses the interplay with known properties of machine motion and its physical underpinnings (steps per unit â†’ pitch of timing belt/lead screw). Difficult chicken & egg dilemmas are resolved by iteration.
