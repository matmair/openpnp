# OnvifIPCamera

Supports IP (network) cameras that support ONVIF.

- Pro: IP cameras can have fixed IP addresses or host names, which makes them very easy to uniquely identify.
- Con: Generally higher latency and lower framerates than USB cameras.

## Configuration

Under the "Camera Specific" tab, "General" section:
- "Camera IP" - Set as &lt;IP address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;. e.g. 192.168.1.193:8899
- "Username" and "Password" - Set to the username and password for your camera. The password is optional.
- "FPS" - Rate at which to grab a new frame from the camera and do any transformations such as applying lens calibration. Set this to the lowest acceptable refresh rate, as excessively high rates will just waste CPU processing time for no reason.
- "Resolution" - Size of the frame to request. Set to &lt;blank&gt; to use the default resolution for your camera. See important note below for Hisilicon SoC based IP cameras.
- "Target Width" and "Target Height" - Resize the captured image to correct for any aspect ratio issues, such as a 16:9 (widescreen) frame being squashed into a 4:3 (NTSC/PAL) image. Set either to 0 to not resize that dimension.

## IP Camera Chipsets

### Hisilicon HI3516 / HI3518 (and variations)

Used in the majority of budget IP cameras from AliExpress/eBay/etc, or resellers of them.
- "Resolution" - Does not support configuring the resolution of captured frames; images will always be PAL/NTSC resolution. If the original native resolution of the camera is not 4:3 (e.g. 720P or 1080P), it will be squashed into a 4:3 image and you must use "Target Width" and/or "Target Height" to restore the image to the original aspect ratio.

### TI Davinci

Please add any limitations or other notes here. These SoC's have not been tested yet, but they are expected to have a more robust ONVIF implementation.
