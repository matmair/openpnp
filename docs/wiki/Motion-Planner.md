## What is it?
The Motion Planner is the central entity planning and coordinating motion across drivers. In many respects it acts like one black-box that behaves as if it were one single driver. 

## Choosing a Motion Planner
The Motion Planner type can be chosen on the machine.

## NullMotionPlanner

**NullMotionPlanner** is the minimal planner selected by default. It is almost completely equivalent to how OpenPnP worked before the Motion Planner was introduced.

The NullMotionPlanner will execute moves one by one. It will wait for each move to complete, before allowing OpenPnP to go on. The machine will always move from complete still-stand in a straight line to complete still-stand, again. This is a very simple and robust model that is equally simple to understand. It is therefore still a valid and attractive choice for those who want to **keep it simple**.

Plus you can still use _some_ of the features offered by the [[Advanced Motion Control]] package, like better axis centric speed control and [[new GcodeDriver settings|GcodeAsyncDriver#gcodedriver-new-settings]].

## ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner

**ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner** is the motion planner that can do the things explained on the [[Advanced Motion Control]] page.

### Motion Interpolation

The ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner can perform full 3rd order Motion Planning a.k.a. Jerk Control. However, most common controllers don't support this. Using time-stepped interpolation, the ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner can then still simulate Jerk Control on these constant acceleration controllers.

See the GcodeAsyncDriver's [[Interpolation settings|GcodeAsyncDriver#interpolation]] for more details.

![Simulated Jerk Control](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/96153482-0dc67200-0f0e-11eb-8d6e-fe7ac8a249eb.png)

### Motion Path Planning

The ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner will first just record the motion that OpenPnP wants to do. Nothing is planned or executed yet. At some point it will be a functional necessity for OpenPnP to make sure the machine is at the target location. One example is wanting to do Computer Vision, obviously the camera needs to be at the target location before it can take a picture. OpenPnP will then ask the Motion Planner to wait for motion completion, which triggers motion planning, execution and finally truly waiting for its completion. 

In the meantime there may have been several moves recorded, creating a motion path. The controller will now receive all the path commands at once, which will allow it to use look-ahead planning and doing subsequent steps as fast as possible without any communications ping-pong in between moves. This alone will increase speed for slow or laggy connections. But the real winner will be [Motion Blending](#motion-blending), explained further below.

OpenPnP will automatically detect, when there are multiple or different drivers/controller involved from move to move. It is obvious, that OpenPnP needs to wait for the first move to complete, before the next move is allowed to proceed. For example: a Z axis on controller A must have finished moving up, before the X, Y axes on controller B are allowed to move (interlock). This will effectively break up the motion path and its planning into multiple parts. It follows that the full potential of advanced Motion Planning will only be exploited, if all the relevant axes (X, Y, Z, C) are on a single coordinating controller.  

OpenPnP will automatically complete Motion Paths in these cases:

* After homing
* Before Camera settle
* Before actuating an Actuator (option that is enabled by default)
* After actuating an Actuator (option that is disabled by default)
* Before reading an Actuator (option that is enabled by default)
* Between moves that contain axes from different and/or multiple drivers (interlock).
* After the Machine Thread has finished a task.
* After a machine task has been aborted by Exception.
* Before a driver connection is closed (unless there is a M400 in the DISABLE_COMMAND, it will not actually wait for motion completion, just for commands to be sent). 

### Actuator Machine Coordination

![Actuator Machine Coordination](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/97218401-eeaac880-17c8-11eb-8cf8-f51ec1f5730b.png)

The **Machine Coordination** options tell OpenPnP when to coordinate the machine/motion with the actuator. 

The **Before Actuation** option is enabled by default. It can be disabled, if you don't want to wait for motion to complete before actuating the actuator. This can be useful e.g. for the light actuator, so the camera will already start to adapt to bright lighting while arriving and do proper [[Camera Settling]] in case the camera has some lag and lagging black images might be mistaken as settled. Or it can be used for feeder actuators, if you want the feed operation to start even while the machine is still moving there. 

The **After Actuation** option is disabled by default. It can be enabled, if OpenPnP must coordinate _after_ the actuation. Wenn you have the **Location Confirmation** option enabled on the driver, each coordination will also update the machine location. This is useful it has changed behind OpenPnP's back. This can happen through custom actuator motion or probing Gcode. For example it is used for the [[Contact Probing Nozzle]]'s probing actuator. 

### Custom Scripts

Custom Scripts now need to explicitly complete a `moveTo()` with a `waitForCompletion()` if they want it to be immediately executed and waited for. 

Example:

`cam.moveTo(location);`

`cam.waitForCompletion(org.openpnp.spi.MotionPlanner.CompletionType.WaitForStillstand);`

There are several options for the CompletionType:

* **CommandJog:** 
  The motion path is executed, assuming an unfinished motion sequence (e.g. when Jogging). 
  More specifically, the motion planner's deceleration to still-stand will not be enforced, it is entirely 
  up to the controller. If a subsequent motion command arrives soon enough, there might be no (or less) deceleration
  between the moves.

  If the driver supports asynchronous execution, this does not wait for the machine to physically complete. 

* **CommandStillstand:** 
  The motion path is executed, finishing in still-stand.

  If the driver supports asynchronous execution, this does not wait for the machine to physically complete.
  
* **WaitForStillstand:** 
  The motion path is executed, finishing in still-stand.

  This does always wait for the controller(s) to complete i.e. the caller can be sure the machine has physically arrived 
  at the final location. For the [[GcodeAsyncDriver]] this will also bring OpenPnP back into location sync when coordinates 
  have changed through actuator custom Gcode (relative moves, Z-contact-probing or similar).

* **WaitForUnconditionalCoordination:**  
  Like WaitForStillStand but it will also be done, if no motion is registered as pending. This is used when the machine 
  might have moved through custom (scripted) Gcode etc. 

* **WaitForStillstandIndefinitely:** 
  Like WaitForFullCoordination but wait "forever" i.e. with very long timeout. Used e.g. for homing.


### Motion Blending 
___
This is still **EXPERIMENTAL**! There is currently no controller that has proven powerful enough for practical use with this. Smoothieware can demonstrate the principle at reduced speed or for small paths, but its internal move queue turns out too small for complex and fast moves. Duet 3D is limited by serial over USB speed. Many others have announced more powerful controllers in the OpenPnP user group, so this feature is now ready for _your_ experiments!

Having recorded a sequence of moves, the ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner is now free to optimize and plan its execution, rearranging and even modiyfing moves within the machine constraints. 

One thing the planner despises are corners. Corners (often 90Â° in OpenPnP) mean the machine must come to (almost) a complete still-stand and then start accelerating from scratch. In OpenPnP, the typical application is the Move-to-Location-at-Safe-Z pattern. The Nozzle is down for a pick or place, then goes up to Safe Z, moves over the target location and then plunges down in Z to pick or place again. 

The NullMotionPlanner would generate a rectangular path, like the first one shown below. The ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner optimizes that path to look more like the second one. Because of the rounded, overshooting curves, the machine does not need to slow down much at any time. Instead, it can speed through the whole path in one fluid motion!

![Move-to-Location-at-Safe-Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/96170324-bc28e200-0f23-11eb-8099-d78cb9ffe1b9.png)

OpenPnP has the notion of a Safe Zone (see the [[Safe Zone axis limits|Machine-Axes#kinematic-settings--axis-limits]]) where no obstacles are allowed, so collisions can be excluded. The motion planners is therefore free to "play" anywhere in this Safe Zone. This is exploited to let the Z axis overshoot, the X/Y axis is already free to start moving, even before the Z axis has come to a stop. The same happens at re-entry, in reverse order. The planner can effectively overlap _or blend_ the deceleration phase of Z with the acceleration phase of X/Y (and vice versa), hence the name "Motion Blending".  

![AdvancedMotionAnimation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/95627544-ab3c2480-0a7c-11eb-8d36-d6921ecf7423.gif)

A blending example will be graphically illustrated in the [Motion Planner Diagnostics](#motion-planner-diagnostics) section, below. 

See the GcodeAsyncDriver's [[Interpolation settings|GcodeAsyncDriver#interpolation]] for the important **Junction Deviation** setting used in Motion Blending.

Also make sure you use the **DirectionalCompensation** method (or **None**) selected in [[Backlash-Compensation]]. Otherwise, this won't work due to small direction changes triggered by [[Backlash-Compensation]] in the corners. 

Finally, it must be repeated that this only works if all the moving axes are attached to the same driver/controller (see the discussion in [Motion Path Planning](#motion-path-planning)).

## Motion Planner 

### Settings

If you have the ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner selected, the **Motion Planner** tab will be available.

![Motion Planner Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/98091935-5bd3f300-1e86-11eb-9ead-9aa8251c5398.png)

**Allow continuous motion?** will enable path recording and will defer planning and execution until there is functional requirement to wait for motion completion. **Caution**: When enabling this on an existing machine, be aware that this may change its behavior. There might be constellation when this requires changes in G-code. Be careful! 

**Allow uncoordinated?** will enable curved motion in the Save Zone. If you want Motion Blending, you must enable this.

**Interpolation Retiming?** the interpolation works using a **velocity over space** polygonal approximation. The straight lines of the polygon used to approximate the curve are acting like "shortcuts". This means that the resulting move is slightly faster than its planned counterpart. By enabling this switch, the interpolated move will be stretched in time, to match the planned time again. Conversely, this will slightly lower the peak velocity when compared to the planned peak velocity. 

### Test Motion 

You can define a test motion with 4 locations and speed factors to test the motion planner in a repeatable way. Be extremely cautious when switching off the **Safe Z?** between locations. OpenPnP will then move in a straight line from location to location with no regard to any obstacles.

Press the **Test** button on the **Motion Planner Diagnostics** tab to execute the Test Motion.

## Motion Planner Diagnostics

If you have the ReferenceAdvancedMotionPlanner selected, the **Motion Planner Diagnostics** tab will be available. The graphical diagnostics plot the movement of all participating axes over time. You get Location, Velocity, Acceleration and Jerk both for the planned motion (strong lines) and their interpolation (light lines). Move the mouse over the graphs to read off values from the plots. 

The following example shows a move with Motion Blending. It is clearly visible, how the Z axis motion _blends_ with the X axis motion over time.

![Motion Planer Diagnostics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9963310/96174107-1e381600-0f29-11eb-8e0a-9a4bd160963b.png)

**Diagnostics?** switches diagnostics on permanently. Each motion plan that is executed by the machine will be diagnosed, the last one will be displayed. This might add a slight CPU load penalty. 

The **Test** button plays the **Test Motion** defined on the previous tab. It does it forward/backward, alternating.

**Planned [s]** indicates how long the move would take as planned, in seconds. This is always available. 

**Actual** indicated the time the move actually took, as measured, including all the overhead. Note, this is only available for the **Test Motion**. In the example screenshot you see how the move took longer than planned. This is due to Smoothieware not offering a queue size that is large enough (RAM too small). Smoothie can therefore not look ahead far enough into the future, therefore it will cautiously decelerate too soon (like driving in fog). See the intro in the [Motion Blending](#motion-blending) section.
