**## This feeder is currently in development and not in a stable state.**

The Index Feeder is a powered feeder design, part of the [Index PnP project](https://github.com/index-machines/index). More information about this feeder design can be found on the [Index Wiki](https://github.com/index-machines/index/wiki). The goal of the Index Feeder is to create a device that is:
* Open source and hackable
* Comprised of readily available and source-able parts so you can build it yourself
* Fully communicative with OpenPnP with a documented and open protocol
* Capable of reliably feeding 0603 components
* Capable of feeding 8mm, 12mm, 16mm, and 24mm tape widths

## OpenPnP Setup

### Slots and Feeder Locations
